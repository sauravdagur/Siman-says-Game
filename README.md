The Simon Says Game is a fun and simple memory game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game:

The computer shows you a sequence of colors (like red, green, yellow, blue).

Your job is to remember and click the colors in the same order.

With each level, the sequence becomes one color longer, making it harder.

If you make a mistake, the game ends, and you can start again.

It's a great beginner project to learn:

How to handle user input with keypress and clicks,

How to use arrays and random numbers,

And how to work with animations and sounds in a website.

This game helps improve your coding skills and lets you build something fun that you can share with others.
